# sap_data_analysis
scripts for analyzing the SAP dataset

All scripts have a ```--working-dir``` command line argument. To run the scripts, use the head directory where your VallE folder is located. For example:

```--working-dir "/scratch/<user>/```

The processed/analyzed data is stored within VallE/egs/sap/...
